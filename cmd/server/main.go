// cmd/server is the xflow control-plane server.
//
// Responsibilities:
//   - Accept workflow submissions via HTTP/gRPC API
//   - Compile WorkflowDef into Graph IR
//   - Enqueue node tasks via TaskQueue
//   - Dispatch queued node tasks to runners via Runner Protocol
//   - Track execution lifecycle (status, completion, cancellation)
//   - Deliver signals to suspended nodes
//   - Serve query APIs (execution status, pending approvals)
//   - Run TimeoutSweep for suspended node expiration
//
// It does NOT execute node handlers — that is the runner's job. Redis, Asynq,
// and StateStore access stay on this side of the boundary.
